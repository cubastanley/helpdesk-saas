This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a full-stack software helpdesk application which allows organisations to configure a triage workflow, notify relevant users of new issues and provide a management and point-of-contact system for users to resolve software issues.
